# Skills and Tools

Shared skills live in `.agents/skills/`, where Codex discovers them directly. Edit these sources, then run `yarn ai-workflow:sync` to generate `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code.

Shared role prompts live in `.agents/roles/*.md`. This is a repository-specific source format, not a native agent discovery path. `scripts/ai-workflow-files.mjs` converts these sources into the app-specific files below; `yarn ai-workflow:sync` writes them. Commit the generated files alongside their sources so a fresh checkout has the native configuration without running a generator first. After removing a source, remove its obsolete generated outputs explicitly; the validator reports them rather than silently deleting files.

## Native discovery paths

Verified against official documentation on 2026-09-12:

| App | Project instructions | Skills used by this repository | Custom agents used by this repository |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Generated `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` imports `@AGENTS.md` | Generated `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Generated `.claude/agents/<name>.md` |

Sources: [Codex skills](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills), [Codex subagents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents), [Claude memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory), [Claude skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), [Claude subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents).

Keep generated agents in each app’s native agent directory. Claude can read referenced `.agents/skills` files as project context and discovers skills through the generated `.claude/skills/` directory.

The AI directories use LF line endings through `.gitattributes` so generated text stays identical across platforms. Supporting skill assets are copied as bytes.

## Roles and models

Keep custom roles for `browser-check`, `profiler`, `test-apk`, `translator`, and `reviewer`. Use the harness's built-in worker/general-purpose or explorer role for ordinary implementation and code discovery. The parent assigns acceptance criteria and ownership; one owner runs heavyweight checks.

Codex agent files include `name`, `description`, and `developer_instructions`. `.codex/config.toml` caps concurrent children at four using `max_concurrent_threads_per_session`. Shared role metadata contains the name, description, and optional sandbox mode; it deliberately has no model fields.

Leave model and reasoning fields out of committed skills and custom agents. Use runtime invocation choices or user settings to override the app’s default or inherited model when needed. Use documented model identifiers. See [Codex selection](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents) and [Claude selection](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#choose-a-model).

`sandbox-mode: read-only` enables Codex’s read-only sandbox. In Claude, the generated tool list and role instructions restrict the review workflow, with Bash still able to write files.

Shared skill frontmatter uses `disable-model-invocation: true` for user-invoked workflows where applicable. Codex's corresponding setting lives in `agents/openai.yaml` as `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`; the validator requires both. Invocation metadata supplements explicit authorization rules; a review request never authorizes publication merely because a skill includes publishing steps.

## Checks and discovery

- `yarn ai-workflow:sync` regenerates compatibility outputs using installed `js-yaml` and `smol-toml`.
- `yarn ai-workflow:check` parses source/frontmatter/configs, checks generated outputs, invocation metadata, model-field placement, and the formatter-only hook wiring. It does not resolve model identifiers against a provider catalog.
- `yarn ai-workflow:test` runs isolated Node fixtures for hook payloads, verification ownership, translation writers, and workflow generation/validation.
- After upgrading an agent application, verify skill/role discovery in that application. Syntax/parity checks do not replace a loader check. Reload the application if an existing session retains an old catalog.
- Hooks require the harness's project trust and hook review; do not bypass trust to make a check pass. See [hooks-setup.md](hooks-setup.md).

## Maintaining useful instructions

Follow [OpenAI’s skills and prompts guidance](https://developers.openai.com/blog/rethinking-skills-and-prompts-for-gpt-6-astra) (reviewed 2026-09-12): keep descriptions precise, load details only when relevant, and preserve the user’s requested scope. Shared skills serve different models; retain project-specific invariants while allowing routine implementation choices.

Keep a skill’s purpose, decision boundaries, and essential constraints in `SKILL.md`. Link substantial mode-specific commands or examples as optional references. Put trigger conditions early in short descriptions; a matching keyword alone should not expand the task. Preserve existing invocation metadata unless its behavior is intentionally being changed.

After a substantial instruction change, exercise a few representative small and large requests. Check which skills/references were selected, whether actions stayed within scope, whether verification matched the change, and whether authorized work completed. Schema and fixture tests establish tooling correctness, not agent decision quality.

## Tools and browser ownership

Prefer the existing skill/tool catalog and installed project CLIs. Use `gh` for GitHub, `playwright-cli` for browser verification, and official/version-specific documentation when library behavior matters. Avoid installing duplicate skills or fetching an unpinned package merely to run an existing formatter.

MCP overhead depends on the harness: deferred tool loading can avoid loading every schema upfront. Keep integrations relevant rather than treating MCP itself as obsolete. Existing CLI choices remain useful for reproducibility and resource control.

All browser sessions use `./scripts/pw-session.sh`, which enforces one active browser machine-wide. Default to a fresh isolated session. Current personal-browser access needs explicit authorization; reuse that authorization in subsequent steps. Choose browsers/viewports for the affected behavior, run selected engines sequentially, close the exact named session in cleanup, and never use `close-all`/`kill-all`. See the `playwright-cli` skill and [verification.md](verification.md).
