## 2026-07-29 — Session 1: research and setup

- Item: (setup, pre-F001)
- Summary: Traced the full pubsub-voting stack before writing code. The library, the criteria
  manifest, and the seeder are all live and mutually consistent; 5chan is the only missing
  consumer. Confirmed the single hard blocker is that 5chan has no interactive signer — the
  existing crypto-wallets setting stores a pasted, static EIP-191 ownership claim, not a
  connected wallet, and pubsub-voting requires on-demand EIP-712 ballot signing.
- Risks investigated and cleared:
  - `better-sqlite3` native dep — **not a new burden**, already arrives via pkc-js 0.0.72.
  - RPC historical depth — **cleared**. `https://sepolia.base.org` served a real `eth_call`
    against multicall3 at exactly 1,296,000 blocks back (the full 30-day expiry window).
    An early `0x` result was a red herring: the Pass contract is only ~11 days old, so it
    genuinely had no code at that depth. `base-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com` rejects archive
    requests outright, so RPC choice does matter.
  - Board data shape — **cleared**. All 65 boards carry both a `.bso` name and a `publicKey`.
  - Contest/directory alignment — **cleared**. Diffed the published manifest against the
    directory codes: 63 contests, exact 1:1, no drift, no per-contest rule overrides.
- Decisions taken (user): injected EIP-6963 first with a WalletConnect fallback; all three
  phases in scope; testnet only, deriving contests from the published manifest at runtime so
  the eventual mainnet manifest needs no code change.
- Files: `docs/agent-runs/pubsub-directory-voting/feature-list.json`, this file
- Verification: `./scripts/agent-init.sh --smoke` — passed (desktop + mobile)
- Blockers: none
- Next: F001 (add deps + viem resolution), then immediately F002 — the browser
  `PubsubVoter` construction spike is the highest-risk unknown and everything downstream
  assumes it succeeds.

## 2026-07-29 — Session 1 (cont.): F001 + criteria mirroring

- Item: F001 (done), F003 (partial), F015 (new)
- Summary: Landed dependencies and proved the library works against the live published
  manifest — 63 criteria documents derived, real topic CIDs computed, republish cadence
  confirmed at exactly 15 days. Extended `scripts/sync-directories.js` to also mirror
  `5chan-directory-criteria.jsonc` byte-for-byte into `src/data/`, matching the existing
  vendored-directories pattern, so the app has an offline fallback and 5chan derives from
  the same bytes the seeder does.
- Upstream gap found: the fresh mirror pulled 65 directory files against only 63 contests.
  `/trash/` is correctly excluded (special board, absent from the defaults file), but `/r/`
  **is** in `5chan-directories-defaults.json` (64 codes) and still has no contest — the
  published manifest looks generated from a defaults snapshot predating the 2026-07-24
  "adult requests board" commit. Worth regenerating upstream in `bitsocialnet/lists`.
  Tracked locally as F015 so the UI degrades cleanly either way.
- Files: `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `scripts/sync-directories.js`,
  `src/data/5chan-directory-criteria.jsonc` (new mirror)
- Verification: `corepack yarn install`, `yarn build` (passes), `yarn sync:directories`
  (mirrored 63 contests), library smoke script against the live manifest
- Blockers: none
- Next: F002 — the browser `PubsubVoter` construction spike against the pkc Helia node.

### Notes for the next session

- The library never reads the bitsocial account. Identity is the wallet that signs the
  ballot: *"the address recovered from the ballot signature IS the voter"*. The stored
  account wallet is only a default-address hint and a mismatch warning.
- The criteria is upvote-only (`voteSchema {min:1, max:1}`, `maxVotesPerAddress: 1`). The
  `-1` button in `src/views/directory/directory.tsx` cannot be represented and must be
  removed; withdrawing is publishing an empty ballot.
- Gateway-mode browsers have no Helia node. Voting must degrade cleanly there rather than
  throwing a construction error.

## 2026-08-09 — Session 2: master sync + pubsub-voting 0.4.0

- Item: task-state refresh before F002
- Summary: Fast-forwarded `codex/feature/pubsub-directory-voting` by 23 commits to
  `origin/master` while preserving and reapplying the uncommitted feature slice. Updated
  `@bitsocial/pubsub-voting` from 0.1.5 to the current 0.4.0 release and refreshed the
  vendored criteria manifest from the canonical lists repository.
- Compatibility update: 0.4.0 registers the soulbound `erc5192-min-balance` gate instead of
  the old transferable-token gate. The canonical manifest moved with it to Pass contract
  `0xA8e0155E0e7d014EAF3917982db6a9A4dF98C852` and now derives 64 contests, including `/r/`.
- Files: `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `src/data/5chan-directory-criteria.jsonc`,
  `docs/agent-runs/pubsub-directory-voting/feature-list.json`, this file
- Verification: `./scripts/agent-init.sh --smoke`, `corepack yarn install`,
  `corepack yarn sync:directories`, `corepack yarn why viem`, 0.4.0 library smoke
  (64 valid criteria and 64 unique topics), `corepack yarn build`, `corepack yarn lint`,
  `corepack yarn type-check`, `corepack yarn test` (1,419 tests), `corepack yarn llms:generate`
- Advisory: `corepack yarn knip` reports `@bitsocial/pubsub-voting` and
  `strip-json-comments` as unused. The former is intentionally staged for F002; the latter is
  imported by `scripts/sync-directories.js`, which Knip does not treat as an app entry.
- Blockers: none
- Next: F002 — the browser `PubsubVoter` construction spike against the pkc Helia node.

## 2026-08-15 — Session 3: master sync before F002

- Item: task-state refresh before F002
- Summary: Merged current `origin/master` into the published WIP branch. Resolved the
  `package.json` overlap by preserving the voting dependencies and viem dedupe while
  taking master’s hooks 0.1.37, pkc-js 0.0.81, React Router 7.18.2, Kubo 0.43.0 packaging,
  and current security resolutions.
- Package decision: npm still reports `@bitsocial/pubsub-voting@0.4.1` as latest. Its
  immutable package delta from 0.4.0 is terminology/documentation plus equivalent
  declaration comments, with no runtime, API, protocol, or dependency change, so the
  branch remains on 0.4.0.
- Verification: pre-merge and post-merge `./scripts/agent-init.sh --smoke`; `corepack
  yarn install`; `corepack yarn build`; `corepack yarn lint`; `corepack yarn
  type-check`; `corepack yarn why` for pubsub-voting, hooks, pkc-js, and viem; full
  `corepack yarn test --run` (169 files, 1,425 tests).
- Test note: the first full-suite run hit the existing intermittent
  `directory-list-lookup-utils.test.ts` module-mock isolation failure. The exact file
  passed 5/5, and the unchanged full-suite retry passed. No feature code was changed for it.
- Advisory: `corepack yarn knip` still reports pubsub-voting and strip-json-comments as
  unused because F002 has not imported them into app code yet.
- Blockers: none
- Next: F002 — construct `PubsubVoter` against the shared browser Helia node and prove
  clean unavailable behavior in gateway mode.

## 2026-08-15 — Session 3 (cont.): F002 shared-Helia construction spike

- Item: F002 (done)
- Summary: Added a small read-only `PubsubVoter` lifecycle hook that reaches pkc-js through
  the public `account.pkc.clients.libp2pJsClients['libp2pjs'].heliaNode` accessor. The
  directory route exposes a nonvisual construction-state marker for runtime verification.
  Browser-libp2p mode constructs successfully; gateway mode has no Helia node and reports
  unavailable without throwing. The hook uses in-memory voter storage and no chain clients
  by design; F004 will replace those spike settings with the shared production singleton,
  Base Sepolia/mainnet clients, `.bso` resolvers, and IndexedDB persistence.
- Reference check: Inspected `Rinse12/pubsub-voting-website`,
  `bso-board-vote.netlify.app`, and the testnet 5chan Pass faucet. The reference voting app
  confirms the same one-PKC-node architecture and currently runs pubsub-voting 0.4.0 with
  pkc-js 0.0.76, reinforcing that 5chan's existing pubsub-voting 0.4.0 and newer pkc-js
  0.0.81 need no package upgrade for this integration.
- Files: `src/hooks/use-pubsub-voter.ts`,
  `src/hooks/__tests__/use-pubsub-voter.test.tsx`,
  `src/views/directory/directory.tsx`,
  `src/views/directory/__tests__/directory.test.tsx`, feature list, this file
- Verification: focused tests (11), full suite (170 files / 1,429 tests), production build,
  lint, type-check, changed-files React Doctor, Chrome/Firefox/WebKit `ready` checks, fresh
  Chrome gateway-mode `unavailable` check, and browser bundle scan with no
  `better-sqlite3`/`node-gyp-build` references.
- Advisory: repo-wide React Doctor still reports pre-existing findings outside this diff;
  Knip now recognizes pubsub-voting as used and retains only the known false positive for
  `strip-json-comments` imported by `scripts/sync-directories.js`.
- Blockers: none
- Next: F003 — finish the runtime criteria manifest loader and its 64-contest mapping tests,
  then F004 — turn the proven construction seam into the shared production voter singleton.

## 2026-08-15 — Session 3 (cont.): F003 runtime criteria loader

- Item: F003 (done)
- Summary: Added a framework-independent JSONC loader for the published directory voting
  manifest. It derives criteria through pubsub-voting's canonical helper, builds both
  directory-code and contest-id indexes, rejects malformed or duplicate slot mappings, and
  validates a remote response before replacing the last good local copy. Consumers can read
  the cached/vendored snapshot immediately and request one deduplicated runtime refresh; a
  successful response is reused for one hour, while failures retry after one minute.
- Live evidence: The canonical raw GitHub manifest and vendored fallback have the same
  SHA-256 (`35e1bb1772e37a456912ea3958588eb2ffa0a534209ace21e969d4b4d9145d25`).
  A live derivation produced 64 criteria with 64 unique contest ids.
- Files: `src/lib/directory-vote-criteria.ts`,
  `src/lib/__tests__/directory-vote-criteria.test.ts`, feature list, this file
- Verification: six focused tests covering the 64-contest set, `/b/` and `/r/` mappings,
  intentional `/trash/` absence, JSONC stripping, invalid and duplicate mappings, validated
  remote caching, cache reuse, and offline fallback; full suite (171 files / 1,435 tests),
  production build, changed-files React Doctor, lint, and type-check pass.
- Blockers: none
- Next: F004 — production voter singleton with Base Sepolia/mainnet chain clients, `.bso`
  resolvers, and browser IndexedDB persistence, using the F002 Helia seam and F003 criteria.

## 2026-08-17 — Session 4: pubsub-voting 0.5.0 criteria cutover

- Item: F001 compatibility refresh
- Summary: Updated `@bitsocial/pubsub-voting` from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0 and refreshed the
  vendored criteria from the canonical lists repository. This is a coordinated protocol
  cutover: criteria now use `gate: { rule: ... }`, a top-level numeric `bucketChainId`, and
  no longer repeat a chain ticker inside the rule or `requires`. All 64 contest criteria
  receive new CIDs and therefore new pubsub topics; votes on the old topics are not migrated.
- Compatibility evidence: npm and GitHub publish 0.5.0 as latest. The canonical manifest
  migrated in bitsocialnet/lists commit `240409439`, and bitsocial-seeder 0.10.0 also pins
  pubsub-voting 0.5.0, so 5chan, the list, and the seeder derive the same topics.
- Verification: live and vendored manifest SHA-256 match
  (`2b5db8aaf0a12720e14962ee345d19229fbac0348c96d47e8141f6cb8b5c3e8d`); 0.5.0
  library smoke derives 64 criteria and 64 unique topics; focused hook/loader tests,
  production build, lint, type-check, changed-files React Doctor, and the full suite
  (171 files / 1,435 tests) pass. The browser JavaScript bundle contains no
  `better-sqlite3` or `node-gyp-build` references.
- Advisory: Knip retains only the known `strip-json-comments` false positive; it is imported
  by `scripts/sync-directories.js`, which Knip does not treat as an application entry.
- Files: `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `src/data/5chan-directory-criteria.jsonc`, feature list,
  this file
- Next: F004 — production voter singleton with chain clients keyed by numeric chain id,
  `.bso` resolvers, and browser IndexedDB persistence.

## 2026-08-18 — Session 5: pubsub-voting 0.6.1 and republishing ownership

- Item: F001 compatibility refresh; F010-F012 design refresh
- Summary: Updated `@bitsocial/pubsub-voting` from 0.5.0 to 0.6.1. Version 0.6.0 moves
  `signer` from the shared `PubsubVoter` to each `createContestVote` call, renames the
  ambiguous `succeeded` publishing state to `published`, and exposes the published bundle
  CID plus local and peer verification evidence. Version 0.6.1 signs provider announcements
  so current routers retain a seeder's records. Criteria bytes are unchanged, so this upgrade
  does not fork the 64 directory topics.
- Compatibility evidence: F002's constructor remains valid without a signer, but its test used
  the removed `readOnly` property. The helper is now named for its actual in-memory storage and
  the obsolete assertion is gone. Future casting passes a signer per ballot. bitsocial-seeder
  0.10.5 also pins pubsub-voting 0.6.1.
- Republishing decision: keep persisted vote intent and refresh UX in 5chan. Store the
  `PublishOutcome.cid` and `bundle.blockNumber`, restore attribution with
  `contest.trackOwnBundle(cid)`, and use `republishIntervalBuckets(criteria)` to detect when
  a refresh is due. On app foreground, show one explicit wallet-signature prompt; do not keep
  keys hot or pretend a closed browser can refresh. pkc-js remains the bare shared-node layer.
  Extract generic scheduling mechanics to bitsocial-react-hooks only after another React
  consumer proves the shared API.
- Verification: 0.6.1 derives the same 64 criteria and topic CIDs as 0.5.0, with a
  360-bucket recommended refresh cadence. Focused hook/criteria tests, production build,
  lint, type-check, changed-files React Doctor, and the full suite (171 files / 1,435 tests)
  pass. The browser JavaScript bundle contains no `better-sqlite3` or `node-gyp-build`
  references.
- Advisory: Knip retains only the known `strip-json-comments` false positive from the
  directory sync script.
- Files: `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `src/hooks/use-pubsub-voter.ts`,
  `src/hooks/__tests__/use-pubsub-voter.test.tsx`, feature list, this file
- Next: F004 — production voter singleton, followed by the read tally path; F010-F012 then
  have the updated 0.6.1 casting, persistence, and refresh contracts.

## 2026-08-21 — Session 6: master sync + production voter singleton

- Item: F004 (done)
- Summary: Merged current `origin/master` as `4acef71a4`, bringing the WIP branch current
  with 5chan's `/search/` directory, bitsocial-react-hooks 0.1.39, pkc-js 0.0.85, and the
  v0.9.19 app baseline. Replaced the F002 in-memory construction spike with a long-lived
  browser voter shared by every route using the same PKC Helia node and `.bso` resolver set.
  The voter now uses persistent IndexedDB storage and a shared Base Sepolia viem client;
  individual contest hooks remain responsible for joining and stopping their own topic.
- Chain evidence: the previously verified official Base Sepolia endpoint returned
  `no backend is currently healthy to serve traffic` during this session, and the preconf
  endpoint was also unavailable. `https://base-sepolia.drpc.org` successfully served both
  the current Pass contract ERC-5192 check and a historical call 1,296,000 blocks behind
  head. The voter therefore uses dRPC first with the official standard and preconf endpoints
  as fallbacks. PublicNode remains excluded because its historical call failed.
- Architecture: 5chan reuses `account.pkc.nameResolvers` rather than constructing a second
  `.bso` resolver or Ethereum client. No HTTP routers are added, and unsupported chain ids
  return no client so pubsub-voting recuses the contest with `MissingChainClientError`.
- Files: `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `src/lib/pubsub-voter.ts`,
  `src/hooks/use-pubsub-voter.ts`, `src/hooks/__tests__/use-pubsub-voter.test.tsx`, feature
  list, this file
- Verification: focused voter tests (7), full suite (176 files / 1,480 tests), production
  build, lint, type-check, changed-files React Doctor, desktop/mobile smoke, and a live
  current-plus-historical Base Sepolia check. Repo-wide React Doctor still exits on
  pre-existing findings outside this branch's changed scope; the changed-files scan passes.
- Blockers: none
- Next: F005 — lazily create and subscribe to only the directory contest being viewed,
  expose its verified ranking, and stop that topic on unmount.

## 2026-08-21 — Session 6 (cont.): lazy per-directory tally hook

- Item: F005 (done)
- Summary: Added a `useSyncExternalStore` read path that refreshes the canonical criteria
  manifest, creates only the contest for the directory currently being viewed, and exposes
  its ranking plus `chainVerified` and `nameResolved` flags. Identical live and vendored
  criteria keep the same object identity, avoiding a pointless leave/rejoin when the runtime
  manifest is unchanged. Transient contest errors preserve the last tally so the directory
  can remain useful while explaining that verification is degraded.
- Library surprise: pubsub-voting's `Contest.on()` has no matching unsubscribe method, while
  repeated `createContest()` calls return the same cached Contest. Attaching callbacks from a
  normal React effect would accumulate dead callbacks on every directory revisit. The hook
  therefore keeps one WeakMap-backed adapter per voter and criteria object; it attaches one
  permanent update/error pair to the cached Contest, fans out only to current React
  subscribers, reference-counts them, and calls `stop()` when the last one leaves.
- Files: `src/lib/directory-vote-criteria.ts`,
  `src/lib/__tests__/directory-vote-criteria.test.ts`,
  `src/hooks/use-directory-vote-criteria.ts`, `src/hooks/use-vote-tally.ts`,
  `src/hooks/__tests__/use-vote-tally.test.tsx`, feature list, this file
- Verification: focused criteria/tally tests (14), full suite (177 files / 1,487 tests),
  production build, lint, type-check, changed-files React Doctor, and advisory Knip. Knip
  retains only the known `strip-json-comments` false positive from the directory sync script.
- Blockers: none
- Next: F006 — consume the hook on the directory page, map tally rows to boards by public key,
  render verified/provisional scores in the existing column, and order the list by live weight.

## 2026-08-21 — Session 6 (cont.): live directory scores

- Item: F006 (done)
- Summary: Connected the lazy tally hook to the existing directory table. Before a tally is
  ready, 5chan preserves the current static score and ordering as an offline/gateway fallback.
  Once ready, only allowlisted boards whose public key matches a tally row receive that row;
  bigint vote weight becomes authoritative, zero-vote candidates render `0`, and static manual
  scores no longer influence live ties. Rows still awaiting either chain or carried-name
  verification show a compact `?` with the existing Pending label.
- Live evidence: fresh isolated Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit sessions all loaded
  `/a/directory`, joined only the `/a/` contest, and settled on the same fully verified live
  score of `1`. Desktop (1440x900) and mobile (390x844) stayed within the viewport in every
  engine. Browser consoles continued to show existing delegated-routing 404s and failed peer
  WebSocket dials, but no tally-hook exception; the contest reached `ready` despite that normal
  decentralized discovery churn.
- UX review: the existing dense table, theme colors, square geometry, and text controls are
  unchanged. The only new visual is the small superscript pending marker; no rounded UI,
  shadows, transitions, hover fills, or new accent colors were introduced.
- Files: `src/lib/directory-vote-ranking.ts`,
  `src/lib/__tests__/directory-vote-ranking.test.ts`,
  `src/hooks/use-directory-vote-criteria.ts`, `src/views/directory/directory.tsx`,
  `src/views/directory/directory.module.css`, `src/views/directory/__tests__/directory.test.tsx`,
  feature list, this file
- Verification: focused tests (18), full suite (178 files / 1,492 tests), production build,
  lint, type-check, changed-files React Doctor, Knip, native-dependency bundle scan, and the
  three-engine desktop/mobile browser matrix.
- Blockers: none
- Next: F007 — add an injected-wallet connection model and mismatch warning, without enabling
  vote publication until the per-ballot signer adapter is covered by the conformance vector.

## 2026-09-23 — Session 7: master sync, casting, refresh, in-app submission

- Items: F009-F012, F014, F015 (done); F007-F008 (dropped); F013 (deferred to mainnet)
- Summary: Merged current `origin/master` (74 commits; conflicts in `package.json`,
  `yarn.lock`, `sync-directories.js`, the vendored defaults, and `directory.tsx`, whose styles
  moved to `components/directory-layout`). Updated pubsub-voting 0.7.0 to 0.7.7 and aligned the
  gossipsub resolution to 17.0.1, which both pkc-js 0.0.101 and pubsub-voting declare.
- Signer decision (developer, 2026-09-23): ballots are signed with the 5chan account's built-in
  ETH key, so voting needs no browser wallet and refreshes are silent. The Pass must be held by
  that address. The future purchase flow must warn buyers to back up their account, since a
  soulbound Pass cannot move to another key.
- Casting: `+1` toggles the account's single vote per directory; `Unvote` publishes an empty
  ballot; `-1` is gone. Eligibility is checked before publishing because gossipsub gives no
  acceptance feedback. An ineligible testnet voter sees its voting address and the free faucet.
- Submission: the "Submit a Board" controls focus an in-page form. Voting for a typed `.bso`
  name or public key submits it; tally rows missing from the lists file render after listed
  boards as nominations, with squatted names hidden.
- Testnet guard: any `bucketChainId` other than Ethereum mainnet keeps the file's order and adds
  a testnet note. Ethereum mainnet chain clients (archive-capable public RPCs: drpc, tenderly,
  1rpc, blastapi; publicnode and cloudflare refuse 30-day-old calls) and mainnet contest ids
  without `test-` are already accepted, so the mainnet manifest needs no code change.
- Upstream: the lists manifest now has 65 contests (`/oc/` added); the vendored copy was
  refreshed by `sync:directories`.
- Verification: full suite (195 files, 1,801 tests), `yarn agent:verify` (build, lint,
  type-check, Doctor, 24 perf cases), Chrome desktop/mobile and WebKit on `/biz/directory`
  against the live testnet contest (tally ready, static order kept, +1 and form submission both
  reach the eligibility notice for a fresh account, unknown names report not found). Firefox was
  not verified: Playwright's Firefox hung at launch on this machine, even on a blank page.
  On mobile the table still scrolls horizontally inside the board layout, as on master.
- Not verified: a successful publish from an eligible wallet in the browser. The faucet requires
  a captcha; minting a test Pass to the account's voting address and voting once would close it.
- Next: F013 homepage winner and the mainnet manifest once the 5chan Pass is deployed.
