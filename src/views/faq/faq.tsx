            Read the rules for the board you are using. 5chan has no global rules page that overrides every board. Each board owner and moderator team decides what

            Open a board, fill out the post form, optionally add a name, subject, comment, and link, then submit. Some boards require a media link for new threads. Some

        answer: (
          <>
            Leave the <code>[Name]</code> field blank. The post will display as Anonymous. 5chan still signs posts with your local account key, so anonymity means "not
            using a display name", not "no cryptographic identity exists".

        answer: (
          <>
            There is no central username registry. 5chan creates a local account for you, and you can edit your display name in the post form or settings. For a stronger
            identity, you can use a readable crypto address such as <code>myname.bso</code> after configuring the matching Bitsocial record. Display names by themselves
            are not proof of identity.

            Not currently. 5chan uses key-controlled accounts and optional readable crypto addresses instead of 4chan-style tripcodes. If you need a persistent identity,
            back up your account and use a resolvable address instead of relying on a display name.

        answer: (
          <>
            Paste a direct media URL into the <code>[Link]</code> field. 5chan detects images, GIFs, video, audio, and supported embeds. Direct links work best. If the
            link is detected as a webpage instead of media, try a direct file URL or a different host.

        question: 'Can I upload media directly?',
        answer: (
          <>
            Yes in the Android and desktop apps, where 5chan can hand the file to a media hosting service. Browser uploads are limited by CORS and should use an external
            host first. The board post itself stores text and links; the external media host may still see your IP address when you upload or when other users load the
            file.

        answer: (
          <>
            It depends on the board. Directory boards can require new threads to include a media link. 5chan also filters text-only threads out of some catalog views to
            preserve the imageboard feel, and you can adjust catalog filters when browsing.

            Put <code>{'>'}text</code> at the start of a line for greentext. Use <code>{'>>'}123</code> to reference a post number in the current thread. Clicking a post
            number opens the reply box with the quote inserted, and selecting text before replying can insert the selected text.

            Yes. Cross-board quotes use the familiar <code>{'>>>/board/post'}</code> shape, such as <code>{'>>>/g/123'}</code>. 5chan resolves directory codes and board
            addresses when it can find the target.

            Usually. Use the spoiler checkbox for media when the board allows it. For text, wrap the hidden part in <code>[spoiler]hidden text[/spoiler]</code>. Some
            boards disable spoilers for posts or replies.

        answer: (
          <>
            Use the post menu or edit controls when they are available. Author deletion and editing depend on your local account, the board's pseudonymity mode, and
            whether the app can prove that your account authored the post. Deleting publishes an edit to the board; it is not a global erase button for every copy that
            may already exist elsewhere.

        question: 'How do I report posts?',
        answer: (
          <>
            5chan does not use manual user reports. Moderation is handled automatically by AI moderation, and board moderators review flagged content through the mod
            queue. If you run a board, use the mod queue and edit controls available for that board.

            It may have been deleted by its author, removed or purged by board moderation, rejected by an anti-spam challenge, hidden locally by your filters, archived by
            board lifecycle rules, or unavailable because the board node or gateway is temporarily offline.

            Boards can have thread limits, bump limits, locks, and archive rules. For example, directory metadata can define a bump limit. Once a thread reaches the
            board's limit or is locked or archived, new replies may no longer move it up.

            On imageboards, entering <code>sage</code> in the <code>[Options]</code> field while replying means "do not bump this thread." 5chan cannot implement it as a

            Not always. Bitsocial is optimized for current social content, not permanent archival storage. Old content may still exist on the board operator's node, on

            There is no global 5chan administrator with authority over every board. Each board has its own owner and can have its own moderators. App maintainers can

            <Link to='/pass'>5chan Pass</Link> is a planned supporter pass. It is not available to buy, activate, or renew yet. The current plan is for pass holders to
            participate in directory voting, post on <code>/vip/</code>, and skip compatible posting challenges on boards that support the pass challenge. Final directory
            governance mechanics are still being designed and are expected to include BSO-holder alignment rather than pass-only final control.

            A challenge is a board's posting check. It can be a captcha, rate limit, payment, token gate, allowlist, iframe flow, or custom code. 5chan shows the
            challenge before publishing when the board requires one.

          <>
            Open peer-to-peer pubsub can be flooded by spam. Bitsocial keeps spam resistance local by letting each board choose its own challenge instead of forcing every
            board into one global CAPTCHA or account policy.

            No anti-spam system is perfect, and each board chooses its own policy. Some boards may prefer open posting with lighter moderation. Others may use stricter
            challenges, moderator queues, bans, or allowlists.

            The board node may be offline, the browser gateway may be slow, a media host may block embeds, your local cache may be stale, or a public router may not have

            5chan has no global IP policy, but individual boards, gateways, media hosts, or challenge providers may apply their own rules. Peer-to-peer networking can
            expose network metadata, so do not assume a VPN or Tor makes all activity anonymous.

            5chan usually embeds links to external media rather than hosting browser-uploaded media itself. Copyright complaints about hosted media should go to the media
            host. Board-specific content issues belong with that board's owner or moderators. App repository issues should be limited to the 5chan software itself.

            A board operator runs a Bitsocial node. Bitsocial is designed so community nodes can run on ordinary hardware such as a laptop, Raspberry Pi, or cheap VPS, as
            long as the operator can keep the board online.

        answer: (
          <>
            Communities are addressed by public keys or readable names that resolve to public keys. Clients ask routers for peers that provide the community, fetch the
            latest metadata and content pointers, then fetch the post content from peers. Publishing uses peer-to-peer pubsub plus the board's challenge system.

            IPFS node in the browser, so it can load boards peer-to-peer without centralized IPFS RPC gateways. You can turn pure browser P2P on in advanced settings and
            inspect the connection in <Link to='/all/settings?section=p2p-stats-settings'>P2P stats</Link>. Browser nodes still have restrictions, such as limited inbound
            connectivity, so desktop apps remain the best way to host board data because they run a full Bitsocial node with IPFS Kubo.

            No. Bitsocial avoids putting posts on-chain. Social media does not need global transaction ordering, and skipping a blockchain avoids gas fees, block-time
            delays, and permanent storage bloat.

            No. Federation still depends on servers, admins, domains, and instance policies. Bitsocial communities are peer-to-peer communities addressed by keys, so
            hosting can change without turning one server into the owner of every account and post.

            <code>.bso</code> names are readable Bitsocial names that resolve to public keys through Bitsocial TXT records. 5chan also recognizes some legacy or
            compatible crypto-domain aliases, but the current Bitsocial-first naming is <code>.bso</code>.

        answer: (
          <>
            5chan does not require a central account signup. Your app stores account data, settings, subscriptions, and caches locally. Network peers, gateways, challenge
            providers, and external media hosts may still see normal network metadata. Public crypto addresses, on-chain pass activity, and linked media URLs should be
            treated as public.

        question: 'Is 5chan fully anonymous?',
        answer: (
          <>
            No. 5chan can avoid a central website administrator seeing every poster IP, but peer-to-peer systems still expose network-level information. Bitsocial
            encrypts publication content before it enters pubsub during publishing, but accepted board content is public. You should not treat 5chan as a complete
            anonymity tool.

        answer: (

            No. Bitsocial keeps the latest community state and content pointers lightweight. Old posts may remain available through the board operator, peers, caches, or
            archives, but permanent availability is not guaranteed by the protocol.

            Anonymous is the default display name when no name is provided. It is a posting style, not one shared person. Depending on the board's pseudonymity mode,
            5chan may still show per-post or per-reply user IDs to help readers follow a thread without revealing a chosen name.

            Post on-topic material, source useful links, respect each board's rules, avoid spam, and help new boards build a real culture. Since boards are independent,
